/** 
 * @class BadStripsSvc
 *
 * @brief Maintains lists of bad strips, and provides access methods 
 *
 * First version 3-Jun-2001
 *
 * The bad strips are kept in ascii files, which are read in under
 * the control of the jobOptions file. In the ascii files, strips are
 * marked as hot or dead, but in memory, strips are only bad.
 *
 * The service creates an array of vectors.  The singly indexed array
 * corresponds to a doubly indexed array by tower and layer.
 * 
 * The original design was a vector of vectors, but this was abandoned
 * because some of the code failed on unix.
 * 
 * The use of the bad strips in the clustering algorithm, for example, depends
 * on mixing good and bad strips and still being able to sort in asending strip order.
 *
 * To this end strips are tagged good or bad by left-shifting the strip number by 1
 * and ORing with 0 (good) or 1 (bad). This mechanism is internal to the service.
 *
 * This can be extended to a more comprehensive
 * tagging arrangement if necessary. Another possiblity would be to create
 * a vector of pairs.  This might be more transparent in the long run.
