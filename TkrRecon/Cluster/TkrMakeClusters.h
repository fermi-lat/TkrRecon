	* A set of adjacent hits followed by a gap is a potential cluster. A gap may be a non-hit strip, or 
	* the space between ladders. For each potential cluster, 
	* we ask if it contains any good hits.  If so, the cluster is added, if not, it is dropped. There
	* may be other criteria for dropping a cluster, such as too many hits.
